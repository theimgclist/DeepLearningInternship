This is my personal repository for the Deep Learning Internship program that I am part of.  
The Inkers, Bangalore is providing External Internship Program during this year's summer.  
They have taken close to 450 interns and we will all be working on learning and practicing state of the art Deep Learning models, techniques and algorithms.   
There will be 10 sessions in Phase 1, each of which will have an assignment to finish.  
Here, I will be adding the course content, notes and assignments.  
The program has it's own supporting site that has very useful and rich Machine Learning content - [here](https://mlblr.com/)
